Organise_downloads

A small shell script to move the files from downloads to the folder it should be in one command. (No more clumsy Downloads folder ;-; ;-; ;-;)

Working:-
Just place a code word after the file as _read, _art or something and let the command sort the folder on its own.

change the target dir path here
<pre> ```bash TARGET_DIR="$HOME/"Path" ``` </pre>
