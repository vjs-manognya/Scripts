Scripts

Scripts is a basic repo which contains multiple shell scripts to tackle some of the annoying, boring problems we face. It makes life much easier and helps us to better manage our work and life balance, and also reduce the time we need to spend on non-essential tasks so that we can take out much time for our loved ones.

This repo consists of the following files 
jump.sh - helps us jump back to the previous directory without manually typing cd ../../.. ushh heavy work.
Organise_downloads - A small shell script to move the files from downloads to the folder it should be in one command. (No more clumsy Downloads folder ;-; ;-; ;-;)
